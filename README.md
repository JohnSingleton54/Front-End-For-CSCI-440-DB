# Front-End-For-CSCI-440-DB

frontend1.php is my first attempt to create a front end for a database. My primary reference has been Chapters 1-10 of Learning PHP, MySQL & JavaScript by Robin Nixon. There are still 17 chapters to study, so perhaps there will be a frontend2.php.

I used the MySQL database engraver that I created for CSCI 440 - Database Systems in Spring 2019 (at Montana State University), along with my partners Sierra MacLeod and Philip Giles.
